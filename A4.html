              <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale</h3>
                 <ol>
            <li>Group states into regions</li>
                     <p>-2</p>
                     <p>Grouping states into regions minimized the interstate differences in the number of abortions performed and the number of clinics across the country. Some states had extremely low numbers of abortion clinics, such as Missouri (1), while other states, like Michigan, had an above-average number of abortion clinics (24). Summing these states into regions and then taking the regional average erased some of the disparity. Also, dividing the country into four regions works well both logically and visually; however, it was not easy to find a combination of regions that represented equal degrees of abortion access. In other words, most regional measures were unequal, regardless of however I organized the states. This resulted in a lot of shuffling of states between regions in order to achieve an equal measure across all four regions (which was another problem I had to solve: how many regions should I create in order to reach an even number?). I chose not to delineate state borders on the choropleth map in order to obscure questionable regional boundaries. For example, Louisiana is not thought of as a Midwestern state, yet it is grouped in the Midwest region, so I intentionally erased this state's boundaries, so that the reader will be less inclined to notice and refute the groupings. I considered a number of alternative groupings beyond those shown here—such as census boundaries, time zones, or geographic areas—but these groupings advanced my "FOR" argument most effectively: they show little to no difference in the number of abortions performed by-occurrence as a percent of the total number of abortions in the United States, thus suggesting that access to an abortion is equal across the country, or at least interregionally. </p>
            <li>Title slant and a light color palette</li>
                     <p>-1.5</p>
                     <p>I intentionally kept the theme of this visualization light and hopeful, using colors like yellow and light blue to enhance the softness and persuasiveness of the message. Similarly, I wanted to use a title that avoided any reference to a deficit narrative or faults within the country's reproductive healthcare system. I considered coloring this visualization with simple whites, grays, and maybe a single highlight color, but this palette was less effective at striking hope within the viewer. I also considered making the title more neutral to present a less slanted message, such as “Abortions in America” or “Regional Abortion Profiles in the United States”; however, again, I did not think these titles were as effective at communicating the counterargument to the proposition that I had hoped. I also did not want to push a title slant too far, potentially dissuading a reader from believing my visualization. I thought “Care Within Reach” struck this balance, as it emphasized hope, pragmatism, and reality.</p>
            <li>Visualize abortions by-residence versus by-occurrence according to region using pie charts </li>
                     <p>-1</p>
                     <p>For the pie charts, I organized the data by region for the same reason described above: it minimized interstate differences in the number of abortions performed by-occurrence and by-residents, presenting a medical landscape where there seem to be little to no differences in where abortions are performed and received by residents. I used pie charts to visualize these metrics, since the data were split (nearly) 50/50 for each region, and pie charts effectively visualize proportions, especially when the proportion is evenly divided or segmented into groups that a reader quickly understands, like halves, quarters, thirds, fifths, etc. Arranging the pie charts sequentially next to each other further emphasizes the impression that there are little to no differences between the regions, as each pie chart presents a nearly identical message side-by-side—that the number of abortions performed by-occurrence and by-residence are almost equal, and thus that the demand for an abortion in a particular region is sufficiently supplied for within that region. The actual numbers of abortions are different by region—for example, the west experiences a much higher number of abortions by-occurrence than the south–and this numeric difference might weaken the larger argument of my "FOR" visualization. However, I believe the strong visual cue from the pie charts overpowers these numbers, as it compels the reader to see equivalence before difference.</p>
            <li>List the states included in each region</li>
                     <p>1</p>
                     <p>I considered leaving the regional groupings off of the visualization entirely, in case a reader looked at the regions and found any irregularities within the list; however, I also imagined different instances where such an omission would backfire. For example, if someone is unable to dissect what they are seeing, or they feel like information is being withheld from them, they might become more distrustful or skeptical than they were originally. With this possibility in mind, I decided to include the regional groupings, but only after shrinking them at the bottom of the artboard so that their importance is very low visually and hierarchically. Again, though, this design decision may backfire—someone may be tipped off by the small font at the bottom of the visualization, and they could become curious as to why it feels hidden. But I anticipate readers will see the small text at the bottom, recognize what's being described, read some of the first few states, and then move on without reading the entire list. </p>
            <li>Use a similar format as the opposing visualization</li>
                     <p>0</p>
                     <p>Using a similar format between the two visualizations serves less in terms of persuasiveness or deception as it does facility and credibility. By using a similar template between the two visualizations, readers may feel less inclined to believe that one visualization is honest while the other is deceptive. They both utilize the same visual tools (map, pie charts, etc), and thus appear to be equally equipped with the same amount (and kind) of data as they advance their arguments. Reducing differences in visual formatting also allows the reader to create direct comparisons between the two visualizations, which may bolster a sense of credibility and confidence in answering the proposition.</p>

                <h2>AGAINST the proposition</h2>

                        alt="A Concatenated Visualization with pie charts and a choropleth map showing that abortions are unevently distributed across the United States, using 2020 data." 
                        width = 700/>
               <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale</h3>
                 <ol>
            <li>Title slant and a black-white color palette</li>
                     <p>-1.5</p>
                    <p>Unlike the previous visualization, I wanted this visualization to highlight the unavailability of abortion clinics across the country, and how thousands of people are effectively stranded without any access to life-saving care. To reflect this absence, I used a black/white color binary, since these colors are heavily correlated with nothingness and presence. This binary paints a clear visual image where entire states are blacked out, confronting readers with the reality that many states have very few clinics. In order to achieve this visualization, I inverted the color ramp so that states with higher percentages of no clinics would be blacked out, and states with lower percentages of no clinics would be lighter. This decision transformed states with lower percentages of no known clinics into hotpsots of hope, as their white backgrounds contrast sharply against the dark landscape. I also removed the boundary lines between states so that there were no visual distractions and so the visual gravity of the black-white dichotomy was preserved. The title plays on the visceral fear of being “Left in the Dark,” as it builds off of the large black chunk of the country where there are few abortion clinics. I considered using more neutral colors, such as a white-blue choropleth map where states with higher counts of clinics would be more blue, but this was not nearly as effective as what is shown here.</p>
            <li>List each state’s information for: ratio of abortions by-residence vs. by-occurrence, and percent of counties without a clinic</li>
                     <p>1.5</p>
                     <p>I chose to list the ratio of abortions by-occurrence versus by-residence to show the dramatic difference that exists between states, and thus across the country, in terms of access to an abortion. Unlike the previous visualization, this visualization seeks to pull the disparity between states into full focus rather than regions, placing each state on a spectrum. In other words, this chart earnestly attempts to show how access to an abortion is borne unevenly across the country, isolating each state and its corresponding ratio individually without deception or obfuscation. While this transparency works well to establish credibility with the reader, it does not work well visually. Visualizing a chart with 51 rows leads to overcrowding, and it creates a difficult negotiation for the designer: how to include everything so that you are honest with the reader, while distilling charts to their most fundamental elements so as not to overwhelm the reader. I am not sure if the format shown here perfectly solves that challenge, but I do think it fulfills its attempt to be earnest.</p>
            <li>Visualize the percent of women living in a county without clinic using donut charts</li>
                     <p>-0.5</p>
                     <p>Much like the previous visualization, I used pie charts to show the percent of women living in a county without a known clinic, since pie charts effectively visualize proportions. Whereas in the previous visualization I used pie charts to show equal proportions across the regions, I used pie charts for this visualization for the opposite reason: to reveal unequal proportions between the regions. In the same way that a reader can quickly tell whether a pie chart is evenly divided, they can also tell if it is unevenly divided. And by juxtaposing these uneven pie charts side-by-side, I sought to highlight the extent of this uneven division. Moreover, I used donut charts instead of traditional pie charts for two purposes: the hole in the middle of the chart creates more black space on artboard, emphasizing the sense of being “left in the dark”; and by creating more black space within the chart itself, the message of each chart is literally and figuratively centered by absence. Using a donut chart also reduces the surface area of the white wedge of the pie chart, thus minimizing the impression that there is actually a substantial degree of access to an abortion in some regions, if not all of them. I think standard pie charts would have effectively visualized these differences as well, but by carving out the middle, a donut chart enhances the persuasiveness of the visualization.</p>
            <li>List the states included in each region</li>
                     <p>1</p>
                     <p>My rationale for this decision is similar to that from the previous visualization, although it has less to do with mitigating deception as it does with explaining how groupings were performed. I also chose to keep this section of the visualization to show that there were no alterations made to the regions between the two visualizations. By proving that the regional groupings are consistent between the visualizations, I wanted to drive home the point that there are, in fact, significant interregional differences in accessing an abortion, despite the pattern shown by the "FOR" visualization. Indeed, as visualized by the four pie charts at the top of the artboard (showing the percent of women living in a county without a known clinic in 2020), there are large regional differences in accessing reproductive care in the U.S.. And by informing the reader that these regions are the same as those from the previous visualization, the original impression that there are no regional differences is significantly weakened.</p>
            <li>Use a similar format as the opposing visualization</li>
                     <p>0</p>
                     <p>The rationle behind this decision is exactly the same as that from the first visualization. Using a similar format between the two visualizations serves less in terms of persuasiveness or deception as it does facility and credibility. By using a similar template between the two visualizations, readers may feel less inclined to believe that one visualization is honest while the other is deceptive. They both utilize the same visual tools (map, pie charts, etc), and thus appear to be equally equipped with the same amount (and kind) of data as they advance their arguments. Reducing differences in visual formatting also allows the reader to create direct comparisons between the two visualizations, which may bolster a sense of credibility and confidence in answering the proposition.</p>

        <h2> Final Reflection </h2>
         <hr>
        <body>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Designing earnest data visualizations was the most straightforward part of this process; however, it was not easy. Deciding which data to visualize, and how to depict certain measurements was challenging. These decisions often relied on subjective assessments of what mattered, what didn’t matter, and whether an issue even mattered to begin with. That said, it was not terribly difficult to construct the visualization once these decisions had been made. I found myself letting the data do most of the talking visually at this stage of the project, since there was not much calculation or manipulation necessary to advance my argument against the proposition (i.e. that access to an abortion is unevenly distributed across the United States). </p>
                <p>Alternatively, building deceptive visualization was extremely difficult—especially when the visualization attempts to refute a widely accepted proposition. Transforming, binning, grouping, filtering, and cleaning the abortion data in order to coincide with my “Pro” point of view was exceptionally hard because the argument I tried to advance simply has no bearing in reality. In other words, arguing that abortions are equally distributed across the United States attempts to argue a clearly false claim. In the process of wrangling the data, I realized that sometimes the data are simply unequivocal—that any deceptive visualization must resort to unethical omissions and/or severe calculations that transform the data into entirely new measurements with dishonest implications. </p>
                <p>Striking a balance between these two outcomes—constructing an earnest *and* persuasive visualization—was an engaging exercise of data gymnastics, and I was surprised by how flexible data can be. Binning, dividing, grouping, and filtering certain variables quickly transformed the original patterns within the dataset, altering the “ground truth” of what I had originally inherited. I had never worked with data so methodically, perhaps even deceptively, so I had never encountered this dimension of data—its capacity to bend to the will of its reader or designer. That said, some of the data transformations I experimented with backfired. In some instances, a data transformation completely contradicted my original intent (i.e. it produced patterns inconsistent with my main argument), or the necessary transformations were so blatantly deceptive that the transformation was no longer useful. Figuring out how to work within the boundaries of data visualization and deceptive design quickly became an exercise of trial and error.</p>
                <p>I think a central principle of ethical data analysis is to honor the lived realities and measured phenomena expressed by the data. In other words, ethical analysis acknowledges the patterns present in the data without transformation and does not attempt to bend the data to the will of a particular agenda or actor. Alternatively, data transformations that distort or proactively misrepresent the significance of the data, and any notable patterns that organically emerge, is unethical. This approach to data visualization, to me, is the antithesis of ethical data visualizations, since it manufactures findings that have little to no bearing in reality, and thus dishonors the lived realities or phenomena captured within the dataset.</p>
                <p>I think the discussion above regarding ethical analysis and visualization draws some “bounds” between acceptable versus misleading persuasive design choices. If someone cannot say their visualization is ethical—that their visualization fails to honor the lived reality or measured phenomena of the data as they present themselves–then it is misleading. And in my opinion, it is also unacceptable, since it ventures beyond mere persuasion and becomes intentional manipulation. But where exactly this bound should be drawn is hard to determine. Different readers can react differently to the same visualization, and some persuasive choices register differently based on a reader’s cultural, social, economic, and personal background. This makes it hard to draw a clear boundary between what is acceptable and unethical; however, I think the principle mentioned above can help delineate the degree to which something falls in either camp.</p>
