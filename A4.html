              <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale</h3>
                 <ol>
            <li>Group states into regions with similar population sizes</li>
                     <p>-2</p>
                     <p>Grouping states into regions minimized the interstate difference in the number of abortions performed and the number of clinics across the country. Some states had extremely low numbers of abortion clinics, such as Missouri (NUMBER), while other states, like Michigan, had an above-average number of abortion clinics (NUMBER). Summing these states into regions and then taking the regional average erases the visual and numeric disparity of abortion access across the United States. Dividing the country into regions works well visually, but it was not easy to find a combination that actually produced even numbers across the United States; in other words, most measures were unequal, regardless of how some states were organized. This resulted in a lot of shuffling between regions, as I moved one state from one region into another in order to strike an equal spread of rates across the four regions (which was another problem to solve: how many regions should I create in order to reach an even number?). I chose not to delineate state borders in order to obscure some questionable region boundaries. For example, Louisiana is not typically thought of as a “Midwestern” state, so I intentionally did not highlight this (or other) state borders, so that the reader would be less inclined to notice and potentially refute these groupings. I considered a number of alternative groupings—such as census boundaries, time zones, or geographic areas—but this grouping visualized a counterargument to my proposition most effectively, as it shows little to no difference in the number of abortions performed as a percent of the total number of abortions in the United States, thus suggesting that access to an abortion is equal across the country, or at least interregionally. </p>
            <li>Title slant and using light colors (e.g. yellow) for the artboard palette</li>
                     <p>-1.5</p>
                     <p>I intentionally kept the theme of this visualization light and hopeful, so I used colors like yellow and light blue to enhance the softness of the message and implicit hope imbued in light colors. Similarly, I wanted to use a title that contradicted the proposition—to communicate that abortions are generally available and accessible across the United States—so I avoided language that reinforced a deficit narrative or any faults within the US’s medical infrastructure. I considered coloring this visualization with simple whites, grays, and maybe one highlighting color, but I did not think this palette was an effective design decision to strike hope within the viewer. I also considered making the title more neutral to present a less slanted message, such as “Abortions in America” or “Regional Abortion Profiles in the United States”; however, again, I did not think these titles were very effective at communicating the counterargument to the proposition that I had hoped. I also did not want to push any slant too far, and thereby dissuade a reader from believing my visualization. “Care Within Reach” strikes this balance, as it emphasizes hope, pragmatism, and reality.</p>
            <li>Visualize abortions by-residence versus by-occurrence according to region using pie charts </li>
                     <p>-1</p>
                     <p>For the pie charts, I organize the data by region for the same reason described above: it minimized interstate differences in the number of abortions performed by-occurrence and by-residents, presenting a medical landscape where there are little to no differences in the areas where abortions are performed and received by residents. I used pie charts to visualize these metrics, since the data were split (nearly) 50/50 for each region, and pie charts are effective visualizations for proportions, especially when the proportion is evenly divided or segmented into regular groups that a reader can quickly understand—halves, quarters, thirds, fifths, etc. Arranging the pie charts sequentially next to each other emphasizes the impression that there are little to no differences between the regions, as each pie chart presents a nearly identical message—that the number of abortions performed by-occurrence and by-residence are almost equal, and thus that the demand for an abortion in a particular region is sufficiently supplied for within that region. The actual numbers of abortions are different by region—the west experiences a much higher number of abortions than the south, for example–and this somewhat weakens the narrative that there are little to no differences in terms of abortion access across the country. However, I think the strong visual cue from the pie charts overpowers these numbers and reinforces the reader to see equivalence before difference.</p>
            <li>List the states included in each region</li>
                     <p>1</p>
                     <p>I considered leaving the regional groupings off of the visualization, in case readers took a closer look at the regional boundaries and questioned their formulation; however, I can imagine this omission backfiring, as a viewer would be even less likely to subscribe to the argument presented by the visualization if they are unable to dissect what they are seeing, or they feel like information is being withheld from them. So, I ultimately chose to include the regional groupings, but only after shrinking them and placing them at the bottom of the artboard, demoting their hierarchical importance. Making these groupings so small and out-of-view may also backfire in terms of credibility, but I anticipate readers will see the small text at the bottom, recognize what it’s meant to describe, read the first few states as a smell-test, and then move on without reading the entire list. </p>
            <li>Use a similar format as the opposing visualization</li>
                     <p>0</p>
                     <p>Using a similar format between the two visualizations serves less in terms of persuasiveness or deception as it does facility and credibility. By using a similar template between the two visualizations, readers may feel less inclined to believe that one visualization is honest while the other is deceptive. They both utilize the same visual tools (map, pie charts, etc), and thus seem equally equipped with the same amount of data to advance their arguments. Reducing any differences in visual formatting also allows the reader to create direct comparisons between the two visualizations, which bolsters a sense of credibility, as the reader feels like they have equal amounts of information from the visualizations and are thus equally informed.</p>

               <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale</h3>
                 <ol>
            <li>Title slant and using black and dark gray colors for the artboard palette</li>
                     <p>-1.5</p>
                    <p>Unlike the previous visualization, I wanted to highlight the void of abortion clinics across the country and how thousands of people are effectively stranded without any infrastructure or care to access life-saving care. To reflect this argument, I used colors heavily correlated with absence, nothingness, presence, and abundance: black and white. By painting a very clear visual image with a binary of black and white (and some grays), readers are confronted with a harsh visual narrative that large segments of the country are entirely blacked out, as the percent of counties per state with a clinic are few to none. I intentionally inverted the color ramp so that states with higher percentages of no clinics would be blacked out, and states with lower percentages of no known clinics would be lighter/more white—becoming something like visual beacons of hope and access in an otherwise dark and desolate landscape. I also removed the boundary lines in between states so that there were no distractions that could weaken the visual force of the black-white dichotomy. The title plays on the visceral fear of being “Left in the Dark,” as it directly recognizes the nonexistent number of clinics across most of the country, pulling the objective truth of the situation down to the personal fear and isolation many people feel as they seek an abortion. I considered using more neutral colors, such as a white-blue choropleth map where states with higher counts of clinics would be more blue, but I did not think this was nearly as effective as the decision described above.</p>
            <li>List each state’s information for: ratio of abortions by-residence vs. by-occurrence, and percent of counties without a clinic</li>
                     <p>1.5</p>
                     <p>I chose to list the ratio of abortions by-occurrence versus by-residence to show the dramatic differences that exist between states and thus across the country. Unlike the previous visualization, which erased these differences by grouping states into regions, this visualization seeks to pull the disparity between states into direct focus, putting each state (plus DC) on a spectrum. Bracketing off half of the spectrum to show that only half of the United States performs an equal number of abortions as the number of abortions received by that state’s residents drives home the point that a significant proportion of the country fails to provide sufficient access to an abortion. In other words, this chart earnestly attempts to show readers that access to an abortion is borne unevenly across the country by isolating each state and visualizing its corresponding ratio individually without deception or obfuscation. While this transparency works well to establish credibility with the reader, it does not work well visually. Visualizing a chart with 51 rows easily lends itself to overcrowding, creating a difficult negotiation between including everything in an attempt to be earnest and honest with the reader, while also distilling figures to their most necessary elements so as not to overwhelm the reader and potentially lose their attention.</p>
            <li>Visualize the percent of women living in a county w/o clinic using donut charts</li>
                     <p>-0.5</p>
                     <p>Much like the previous visualization, I used pie charts to  show the percent of women living in a county without a known clinic because they effectively showed the proportion of women for whom that was true or not. While in the previous visualization, the pie charts were effective at showing equal proportions across all four regions,  in this visualization they immediately reveal that proportions are unequal between the regions. In the same way that a reader can quickly tell whether a pie chart is evenly divided, they can also easily tell if it is unevenly divided, as is the case here. By juxtaposing these pie charts side-by-side, I wanted to present the reader with clear numeric and visual differences between the regions in terms of the percent of women who live in a county without a county. Shown in a black-white color palette, the visual binary of the pie chart heightens the difference between regions more than other color combinations might, such as yellow and blue. I also chose donut charts for these data instead of pie charts for two purposes: the hole in the middle of the chart creates more black spaces on artboard, emphasizing the sense of being “left in the dark”; and by creating more black space within the chart itself, the message of is literally and figuratively centered by an absence of clinics in each region. Using a donut chart also reduces the surface area of the white wedge of the pie chart, thus minimizing the impression that there is actually a substantial degree of access to an abortion in some regions, if not all of them. I think pie charts would have effectively visualized these differences, but by carving out the middle, a donut chart enhances the overarching message and intention of the visualization.</p>
            <li>List the states included in each region</li>
                     <p>1</p>
                     <p>My rationale for this decision is similar to that from the previous visualization, although it has less to do with mitigating deception as it does with explaining how groupings were performed. I also chose to keep this section of the visualization to show that there were no alterations made to the regions between the two visualizations. By proving this consistency, I hoped to show readers that there were no blatant data transformations made in one visualization that were not performed on the other—that both artboards rely on the same organization pattern and geographic binning. And by keeping this description at the bottom of the chart, it drives home the point that there actually is interregional difference across the country. As visualized by the four pie charts at the top of the artboard (showing the percent of women living in a county without a known clinic in 2020), there are large regional differences. And by informing the reader that the regions shown here are the same as the previous visualization, the original impression—that there are no regional differences—is significantly weakened.</p>
            <li>Use a similar format as the opposing visualization</li>
                     <p>0</p>

        <h2> Final Reflection </h2>
         <hr>
        <body>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Designing earnest data visualizations was the most straightforward part of this process; however, it was not easy. Deciding which data to visualize, and how to depict certain measurements was challenging. These decisions often relied on subjective assessments of what mattered, what didn’t matter, and whether an issue even mattered to begin with. That said, it was not terribly difficult to construct the visualization once these decisions had been made. I found myself letting the data do most of the talking visually at this stage of the project, since there was not much calculation or manipulation necessary to advance my argument against the proposition (i.e. that access to an abortion is unevenly distributed across the United States). </p>
                <p>Alternatively, building deceptive visualization was extremely difficult—especially when the visualization attempts to refute a widely accepted proposition. Transforming, binning, grouping, filtering, and cleaning the abortion data in order to coincide with my “Pro” point of view was exceptionally hard because the argument I tried to advance simply has no bearing in reality. In other words, arguing that abortions are equally distributed across the United States attempts to argue a clearly false claim. In the process of wrangling the data, I realized that sometimes the data are simply unequivocal—that any deceptive visualization must resort to unethical omissions and/or severe calculations that transform the data into entirely new measurements with dishonest implications. </p>
                <p>Striking a balance between these two outcomes—constructing an earnest *and* persuasive visualization—was an engaging exercise of data gymnastics, and I was surprised by how flexible data can be. Binning, dividing, grouping, and filtering certain variables quickly transformed the original patterns within the dataset, altering the “ground truth” of what I had originally inherited. I had never worked with data so methodically, perhaps even deceptively, so I had never encountered this dimension of data—its capacity to bend to the will of its reader or designer. That said, some of the data transformations I experimented with backfired. In some instances, a data transformation completely contradicted my original intent (i.e. it produced patterns inconsistent with my main argument), or the necessary transformations were so blatantly deceptive that the transformation was no longer useful. Figuring out how to work within the boundaries of data visualization and deceptive design quickly became an exercise of trial and error.</p>
                <p>I think a central principle of ethical data analysis is to honor the lived realities and measured phenomena expressed by the data. In other words, ethical analysis acknowledges the patterns present in the data without transformation and does not attempt to bend the data to the will of a particular agenda or actor. Alternatively, data transformations that distort or proactively misrepresent the significance of the data, and any notable patterns that organically emerge, is unethical. This approach to data visualization, to me, is the antithesis of ethical data visualizations, since it manufactures findings that have little to no bearing in reality, and thus dishonors the lived realities or phenomena captured within the dataset.</p>
                <p>I think the discussion above regarding ethical analysis and visualization draws some “bounds” between acceptable versus misleading persuasive design choices. If someone cannot say their visualization is ethical—that their visualization fails to honor the lived reality or measured phenomena of the data as they present themselves–then it is misleading. And in my opinion, it is also unacceptable, since it ventures beyond mere persuasion and becomes intentional manipulation. But where exactly this bound should be drawn is hard to determine. Different readers can react differently to the same visualization, and some persuasive choices register differently based on a reader’s cultural, social, economic, and personal background. This makes it hard to draw a clear boundary between what is acceptable and unethical; however, I think the principle mentioned above can help delineate the degree to which something falls in either camp.</p>
