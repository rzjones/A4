              <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale</h3>
                 <ol>
            <li>Group states into regions with similar population sizes</li>
                     <p>-2</p>
                     <p>Grouping states into regions minimized the interstate difference in the number of abortions performed and the number of clinics across the country. Some states had extremely low numbers of abortion clinics, such as Missouri (NUMBER), while other states, like Michigan, had an above-average number of abortion clinics (NUMBER). Summing these states into regions and then taking the regional average erases the visual and numeric disparity of abortion access across the United States. Dividing the country into regions works well visually, but it was not easy to find a combination that actually produced even numbers across the United States; in other words, most measures were unequal, regardless of how some states were organized. This resulted in a lot of shuffling between regions, as I moved one state from one region into another in order to strike an equal spread of rates across the four regions (which was another problem to solve: how many regions should I create in order to reach an even number?). I chose not to delineate state borders in order to obscure some questionable region boundaries. For example, Louisiana is not typically thought of as a “Midwestern” state, so I intentionally did not highlight this (or other) state borders, so that the reader would be less inclined to notice and potentially refute these groupings. I considered a number of alternative groupings—such as census boundaries, time zones, or geographic areas—but this grouping visualized a counterargument to my proposition most effectively, as it shows little to no difference in the number of abortions performed as a percent of the total number of abortions in the United States, thus suggesting that access to an abortion is equal across the country, or at least interregionally. </p>
            <li>Title slant and using light colors (e.g. yellow) for the artboard palette</li>
                     <p>-1.5</p>
                     <p>I intentionally kept the theme of this visualization light and hopeful, so I used colors like yellow and light blue to enhance the softness of the message and implicit hope imbued in light colors. Similarly, I wanted to use a title that contradicted the proposition—to communicate that abortions are generally available and accessible across the United States—so I avoided language that reinforced a deficit narrative or any faults within the US’s medical infrastructure. I considered coloring this visualization with simple whites, grays, and maybe one highlighting color, but I did not think this palette was an effective design decision to strike hope within the viewer. I also considered making the title more neutral to present a less slanted message, such as “Abortions in America” or “Regional Abortion Profiles in the United States”; however, again, I did not think these titles were very effective at communicating the counterargument to the proposition that I had hoped. I also did not want to push any slant too far, and thereby dissuade a reader from believing my visualization. “Care Within Reach” strikes this balance, as it emphasizes hope, pragmatism, and reality.</p>
            <li>Visualize abortions by-residence versus by-occurrence according to region using pie charts </li>
                     <p>-1</p>
                     <p>For the pie charts, I organize the data by region for the same reason described above: it minimized interstate differences in the number of abortions performed by-occurrence and by-residents, presenting a medical landscape where there are little to no differences in the areas where abortions are performed and received by residents. I used pie charts to visualize these metrics, since the data were split (nearly) 50/50 for each region, and pie charts are effective visualizations for proportions, especially when the proportion is evenly divided or segmented into regular groups that a reader can quickly understand—halves, quarters, thirds, fifths, etc. Arranging the pie charts sequentially next to each other emphasizes the impression that there are little to no differences between the regions, as each pie chart presents a nearly identical message—that the number of abortions performed by-occurrence and by-residence are almost equal, and thus that the demand for an abortion in a particular region is sufficiently supplied for within that region. The actual numbers of abortions are different by region—the west experiences a much higher number of abortions than the south, for example–and this somewhat weakens the narrative that there are little to no differences in terms of abortion access across the country. However, I think the strong visual cue from the pie charts overpowers these numbers and reinforces the reader to see equivalence before difference.</p>
            <li>List the states included in each region</li>
                     <p>1</p>
                     <p>I considered leaving the regional groupings off of the visualization, in case readers took a closer look at the regional boundaries and questioned their formulation; however, I can imagine this omission backfiring, as a viewer would be even less likely to subscribe to the argument presented by the visualization if they are unable to dissect what they are seeing, or they feel like information is being withheld from them. So, I ultimately chose to include the regional groupings, but only after shrinking them and placing them at the bottom of the artboard, demoting their hierarchical importance. Making these groupings so small and out-of-view may also backfire in terms of credibility, but I anticipate readers will see the small text at the bottom, recognize what it’s meant to describe, read the first few states as a smell-test, and then move on without reading the entire list. </p>
            <li>Use a similar format as the opposing visualization</li>
                     <p>0</p>
                     <p>Using a similar format between the two visualizations serves less in terms of persuasiveness or deception as it does facility and credibility. By using a similar template between the two visualizations, readers may feel less inclined to believe that one visualization is honest while the other is deceptive. They both utilize the same visual tools (map, pie charts, etc), and thus seem equally equipped with the same amount of data to advance their arguments. Reducing any differences in visual formatting also allows the reader to create direct comparisons between the two visualizations, which bolsters a sense of credibility, as the reader feels like they have equal amounts of information from the visualizations and are thus equally informed.</p>

               <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale</h3>
                 <ol>
            <li>Title slant and using black and dark gray colors for the artboard palette</li>
                     <p>-1.5</p>
                    <p>Unlike the previous visualization, I wanted to highlight the void of abortion clinics across the country and how thousands of people are effectively stranded without any infrastructure or care to access life-saving care. To reflect this argument, I used colors heavily correlated with absence, nothingness, presence, and abundance: black and white. By painting a very clear visual image with a binary of black and white (and some grays), readers are confronted with a harsh visual narrative that large segments of the country are entirely blacked out, as the percent of counties per state with a clinic are few to none. I intentionally inverted the color ramp so that states with higher percentages of no clinics would be blacked out, and states with lower percentages of no known clinics would be lighter/more white—becoming something like visual beacons of hope and access in an otherwise dark and desolate landscape. I also removed the boundary lines in between states so that there were no distractions that could weaken the visual force of the black-white dichotomy. The title plays on the visceral fear of being “Left in the Dark,” as it directly recognizes the nonexistent number of clinics across most of the country, pulling the objective truth of the situation down to the personal fear and isolation many people feel as they seek an abortion. I considered using more neutral colors, such as a white-blue choropleth map where states with higher counts of clinics would be more blue, but I did not think this was nearly as effective as the decision described above.</p>
            <li>List each state’s information for: ratio of abortions by-residence vs. by-occurrence, and percent of counties without a clinic</li>
                     <p>1.5</p>
                     <p>I chose to list the ratio of abortions by-occurrence versus by-residence to show the dramatic differences that exist between states and thus across the country. Unlike the previous visualization, which erased these differences by grouping states into regions, this visualization seeks to pull the disparity between states into direct focus, putting each state (plus DC) on a spectrum. Bracketing off half of the spectrum to show that only half of the United States performs an equal number of abortions as the number of abortions received by that state’s residents drives home the point that a significant proportion of the country fails to provide sufficient access to an abortion. In other words, this chart earnestly attempts to show readers that access to an abortion is borne unevenly across the country by isolating each state and visualizing its corresponding ratio individually without deception or obfuscation. While this transparency works well to establish credibility with the reader, it does not work well visually. Visualizing a chart with 51 rows easily lends itself to overcrowding, creating a difficult negotiation between including everything in an attempt to be earnest and honest with the reader, while also distilling figures to their most necessary elements so as not to overwhelm the reader and potentially lose their attention.</p>
            <li>Visualize the percent of women living in a county w/o clinic using donut charts</li>
                     <p>-0.5</p>
                     <p>Much like the previous visualization, I used pie charts to  show the percent of women living in a county without a known clinic because they effectively showed the proportion of women for whom that was true or not. While in the previous visualization, the pie charts were effective at showing equal proportions across all four regions,  in this visualization they immediately reveal that proportions are unequal between the regions. In the same way that a reader can quickly tell whether a pie chart is evenly divided, they can also easily tell if it is unevenly divided, as is the case here. By juxtaposing these pie charts side-by-side, I wanted to present the reader with clear numeric and visual differences between the regions in terms of the percent of women who live in a county without a county. Shown in a black-white color palette, the visual binary of the pie chart heightens the difference between regions more than other color combinations might, such as yellow and blue. I also chose donut charts for these data instead of pie charts for two purposes: the hole in the middle of the chart creates more black spaces on artboard, emphasizing the sense of being “left in the dark”; and by creating more black space within the chart itself, the message of is literally and figuratively centered by an absence of clinics in each region. Using a donut chart also reduces the surface area of the white wedge of the pie chart, thus minimizing the impression that there is actually a substantial degree of access to an abortion in some regions, if not all of them. I think pie charts would have effectively visualized these differences, but by carving out the middle, a donut chart enhances the overarching message and intention of the visualization.</p>
            <li>List the states included in each region</li>
                     <p>1</p>
                     <p>My rationale for this decision is similar to that from the previous visualization, although it has less to do with mitigating deception as it does with explaining how groupings were performed. I also chose to keep this section of the visualization to show that there were no alterations made to the regions between the two visualizations. By proving this consistency, I hoped to show readers that there were no blatant data transformations made in one visualization that were not performed on the other—that both artboards rely on the same organization pattern and geographic binning. And by keeping this description at the bottom of the chart, it drives home the point that there actually is interregional difference across the country. As visualized by the four pie charts at the top of the artboard (showing the percent of women living in a county without a known clinic in 2020), there are large regional differences. And by informing the reader that the regions shown here are the same as the previous visualization, the original impression—that there are no regional differences—is significantly weakened.</p>
            <li>Use a similar format as the opposing visualization</li>
                     <p>0</p>

        <h2> Final Reflection </h2>
         <hr>
        <body>
            <div class="container">
                <p> For the final design, I wanted to produce a visualization that avoided convention and bias in answering its primary research question: how has the population changed across age groups from males and females between 1900 and 2000? As alluded to in the previous section, I chose to focus on proportional differences between age groups for each sex, rather than total values, so that the population increase from 1900 to 2000 would not distort the reader’s interpretation of the data or the readability of the visualization; however, I took this analysis a step farther from the percent difference graphs calculated in the first phase. For the final design, I calculated the population of each age group’s population as a proportion of the total population, against year (1900 vs 2000) and sex (female and male). This produced four sets of proportions: 1900 females by age, 1900 males by age, 2000 females by age, and 2000 males by age. I then subtracted the set of proportions for the year 2000 by those for 1900 (e.g. 2000 females by age – 1900 females by age). The intention behind this calculation was to show how the spread of the population across age changed from 1900 to 2000. In other words, it visualizes segments of the population that increased or decreased as a proportion of the total population over the century. For example, children made up a much larger segment of the total population in 1900 than 2000, even though the total population of children grew from 1900 to 2000. This subtle trend in the data would have been lost in a general bar chart, but this visualization represents that difference as a negative percent difference bar, extending below the x-axis into the negative section of the y-axis. And by using sex as one of the dimensions in the chart, the visualization also shows how these differences varied for males and females. </p>
                <p> With respect to my design rationale, I wanted to produce a visualization that went beyond a simple bar chart illustrating total population growth from 1900 to 2000 by sex and age; however, I still wanted to combine all measures and dimensions in a single visualization as clearly as possible. Formatting the percent difference as the y-axis allowed the bars to surface above the x-axis as positive values or plummet below the x-axis as negative values, emphasizing the aging of the population from 1900 to 2000. I also wanted to avoid design conventions and symbologies that reify the gender and sex binary; this meant choosing colors and shapes that worked against the Pink-Blue binary, as well as the light- and dark-hued binary of a single color, which can sometimes ascribe more value to darker colors and less value to lighter colors. Therefore, the choice to use yellow and brown was an intentional design decision—one aimed at producing an unbiased comparison between males and females. I also intentionally organized the sex labels with “Female” first and “Male” second, recognizing that the typical order places females, women, and other non-male identifying peoples secondary to men. </p>
